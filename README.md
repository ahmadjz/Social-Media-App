## State Management
Instant-Gram uses Riverpod for state management, which provides a simple and efficient way to manage app state. Riverpod is a Provider package and is used to handle dependency injection and state management in Flutter applications.
The implementation of Riverpod in this project was heavily influenced by [Vandad Nahavandipoor's course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtGCteFYs4M&t) on Riverpod on Youtube.

## Firebase
Instant-Gram uses Firebase as its backend service. Firebase provides several tools and services such as Cloud Firestore, Authentication, and Storage, which make it easy to build and scale your app. Cloud Firestore is used to store and retrieve data, Authentication is used to authenticate users, and Storage is used to store and retrieve user-generated content.
